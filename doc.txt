The pool works using the following aglorithm:

A user initiates the pool by giving it the number of threads it should contain:
	-First, we create a semaphore and set it to 0 (locked)
	-We create all threads and send them to the waiting-function
	-In the waiting function, in an infinite loop, all threads wait
		on the semaphore
	All threads will remain like this for the time being

When a user requests a job, they should send a function pointer and a parameter:
	-First, if all threads are busy, we fail gracefully
	-We set a global function pointer to be the passed function pointer
	-We set a gloabl void* pointer to equal the parameter passed
	-We then icrement the semaphore by one, which will allow exactly one
		blocked thread to go on

The blocking thread that was allowed to go on will simply call the global 
function pointer and give it the global void* as a parameter, when this call is
over, the thread will iterate our infinite loop and block at semaphore wait

Note that to check how many threads are busy, we keep a counter that gets 
incremented everytime a thread leaves the semaphore wait and gets decremented
everytime a thread approaches the semaphore wait.
Also note that access to this counter should be protected with a mutex 

Access to the function pointer or its public data does not need to be protected
as it can only be changed under the protection of the semaphore used here

Names:
job: refers the job a user requests a thread for
the mutex: refers to the mutex we're using to protect the busy thread counter
the semaphore: refers to the semaphore that we're using to signal to threads
