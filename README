This is a thread-pool that is to be used on UNIX systems instead of calling raw-threads.
The objective is to minimize thread creation/deletion time and utilize the threads available in the pool.

The pool is gonna be implemented to be callable from C, for the time being.

The work is BSD-2 licensed.
